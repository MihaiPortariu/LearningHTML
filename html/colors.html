                <h2>Defining Colors</h2>
                <div class="empty_space0"></div>
                <p>Colors can be defined in a few ways. For example, this shade of blue may commonly be defined in three different ways in webpage styles:<br> 
                    rgb (97, 97, 255): The amount of red, green, and blue that form a color are each presented as a number between 0 and 255. #6161FF: This is 
                    a "hexadecimal" format where the red/green/blue values are presented as a combination of six letters or numbers. Typically called "Hex," this 
                    is a very common format in webpages. hsl (240, 100%, 69%): Hue, saturation, and lightness map more closely to the way people perceive colors. 
                    Changing the "lightness" of a color will change its contrast ratio to another color.</p>

                    <h2><b>Contrast Ratio</b></h2>
                    <div class="empty_space0"></div>
                    <p>In WCAG 2, contrast is a measure of the difference in perceived
                        "luminance" or brightness between two colors (the phrase "color
                        contrast" is never used). This brightness difference is expressed
                        as a ratio ranging from 1:1 (e.g. white on white) to 21:1 (e.g., black on a white).
                        To give a frame of reference, on a white background  </p>

                    <P>Pure red (#FF0000) has a ratio of 4:1. I am red text.<br>
                        Pure green (#00FF00) has a very low ratio of 1.4:1. I am green text.<br>
                        Pure blue (#000FF) has a contrast ratio of 8.6:1. I am blue text</P>
                    <p>in order to be Level AA conformant, your page must have all of the following:

                        A 4.5:1 contrast between the non-link text color and the background.
                        A 4.5:1 contrast between the link text color and the background.
                        A 3:1   contrast between the link text color and the surrounding non-link text color.

                    </p>In other words, your link color has to be significantly different from the background color
                        AND the surrounding text color, which also has to be significantly different from the background color.</p>
