                <p>Colors can be defined in a few ways. For example, this shade of blue may commonly be defined in three different ways in webpage styles: 
                    rgb (97, 97, 255): The amount of red, green, and blue that form a color are each presented as a number between 0 and 255. #6161FF: This is 
                    a "hexadecimal" format where the red/green/blue values are presented as a combination of six letters or numbers. Typically called "Hex," this 
                    is a very common format in webpages. hsl (240, 100%, 69%): Hue, saturation, and lightness map more closely to the way people perceive colors. 
                    Changing the "lightness" of a color will change its contrast ratio to another color.</p>
