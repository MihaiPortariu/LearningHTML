                <h2>History</h2>
                <p> The first web accessibility guideline was compiled by Gregg Vanderheiden
                     and released in January 1995, just after the 1994 Second International 
                     Conference on the World-Wide Web (WWW II) in Chicago (where Tim Berners
                     -Lee first mentioned disability access in a keynote speech after seeing a pre-conference workshop on accessibility 
                    Over 38 different Web access guidelines followed from various authors and organizations over the next few years.
                     These were brought together in the Unified Web Site Accessibility Guidelines compiled at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.
                     Version 8 of the Unified Web Site Accessibility Guidelines, published in 1998, served as the starting point for the W3C's WCAG 1.0.
                </p>
                <h3>WCAG 1.0</h3>
                <p> The WCAG 1.0 were published and became a W3C recommendation on 5 May 1999.
                          They have since been superseded by WCAG 2.0.
  
                        The first concept proposal of WCAG 2.0 was published on 25 January 2001. 
                        In the following years new versions were published intended to solicit 
                        feedback from accessibility experts and members of the disability community. 
                        On 27 April 2006 a "Last Call Working Draft" was published.
                        Due to the many amendments that were necessary, WCAG 2.0 were published 
                        again as a concept proposal on 17 May 2007, followed by a second "Last Call Working Draft"
                        on 11 December 2007. In April 2008 the guidelines became a "Candidate Recommendation". 
                        On 3 November 2008 the guidelines became a "Proposed Recommendation".
                         WCAG 2.0 were published as a W3C Recommendation on 11 December 2008.
                </p>
                <P> In October 2012, WCAG 2.0 were accepted by the International Organization for Standardization
                            as an ISO International Standard, ISO/IEC 40500:2012
                            In early 2014, WCAG 2.0's Level A and Level AA success criteria were incorporated as references
                            in clause 9.2 ("Web content requirements") of the European standard EN 301 549 published by ETSI.
                            EN 301 549 was produced in response to a mandate that the European Commission gave to the three
                            official European standardisation bodies (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI) and is the first European standard
                            for ICT products and services.

                 <h2><b>Abstract</b></h2>
                 <p> 
                    The focus of much academic work on Web accessibility has been concerned with the lack of implementation of
                    the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. There seems, as yet, however, to have been little critical reflection
                    on the Guidelines themselves — save perhaps some awareness of the heterogeneous nature of the Web, and the 
                    difficulties facing Web developers trying to ensure their work displays true to their intentions across a wide
                    range of different browsers and devices, making use of continually evolving and contested code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet, as this paper highlights, the long drawn out process by which version 2.0 of the WCAG came into being
                    hides many skeletons, including aspects of the process of developing standards that bear closer scrutiny, and 
                    reveal much when viewed through Latourian eyes. The findings of this paper suggest that the WCAG2.0 are almost
                    irrelevant today — to the detriment of those for whom they were made — and that the process of creating them was at fault.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible.
                    Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities,
                    including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, 
                    limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these.
